## Family Metrics

| Family | Runs | Executed Speedup vs Exact | Contract Compliance | Fallback Rate | Raw Error Mean |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| dense_random | 9 | 0.856x | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.000000 |
| compressible_lowrank | 9 | 2.972x | 1.000 | 0.000 | 0.002500 |

## Decision

- Suggested decision: `iterate`
- Rationale: Core T4 metrics pass on this prototype, but policy depends on workload-specific compressibility assumptions and needs production-grade factorization integration.
