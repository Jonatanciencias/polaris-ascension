# Roadmap Status Snapshot - Week 6 (2026-02-07)

## Execution State

- Week 5 Block 1 (T3): completed (`iterate`)
- Week 5 Block 2 (T4): completed (`promote`)
- Week 5 Block 3 (T5): completed (`promote`)
- Week 5 Block 4 (Platform compatibility Rusticl/ROCm): completed (`refine`)
- Week 6 Final Suite + Closure: completed (`promote`)

## Current Position

Roadmap breakthrough 2026Q1 is **closed** at governance level with reproducible evidence and formal decisions.

## Remaining Non-Blocking Debt

1. Legacy test collection outside canonical `tests/`.
2. Production platform selection hardening for Rusticl canary route.
3. Driver diagnostics script alignment (`verify_drivers.py`) with actual pyopencl/clinfo signals.
